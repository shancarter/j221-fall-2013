##How to Probe Unknown Data
So you have your shiny new R skills and youâ€™ve successfully loaded a cool dataframe into R... Now what?

1. Make sure all your columns are the correct data type (nums, strings, factors, dates)
  [Changing data types in R](tktk)

2. View some summary stats on your number columns (min, max, mean)

3. Chart some histograms of your number columns (distributions)

4. Chart some histograms of your categorical columns (sex, type of incident)

5. Plot a time series of your date column

6. Plot a time series, but aggregated up to a different time frame (days to months, months to years)

7. Look for correlations

8. Look for outliers

9. Most importantly, ask questions in plain English and try to answer them. WHat month was X highest or lowest? How has field Z changed since policy X was implemented? What's the relationship between X and Y? What does the distribution of one column of data tell us?
