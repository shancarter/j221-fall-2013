##How to Probe Unknown Data
So you have your shiny new R skills and youâ€™ve successfully loaded a cool dataframe into R... Now what?

1. Make sure all your columns are the correct data type (nums, strings, factors, dates)

2. View some summary stats on your number columns (min, max, mean)

  ```r
  summary(data)

  summary(data$column)

  table(data$column)
  ```

3. Chart histograms of your numeric columns (distributions)

4. Chart histograms of your categorical columns (gender, color, etc..)

  ```r
  plot(table(data$column), type="h")
  ```

5. Plot a time series of your date column

6. Plot a time series, but aggregated up to a different time frame (days to months, months to years)

7. Look for correlations and outliers

  ```r
  #plots all the combinations of all your columns
  pairs(data)

  #If you want to plot just one of the combinations for more detail
  plot(data$column1, data$column2)
  ```
